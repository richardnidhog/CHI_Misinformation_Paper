This stuff doesn't work. Sudafed is the only decongestant that works, but you want one worse? This one. Dexmethorphan. So we use it for kids' coughs. Well, last month they put it inside of a medication with bupropion, which is wellbutrin, because it makes the bupropion work better. That's right. You're giving your kids a cough syrup that we know messes with their brains. This one, dexmethorphan, will be the next one to go.
