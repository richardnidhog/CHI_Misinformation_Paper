discriminated against because you didn't get a vaccine. You should be applauded because you didn't get a vaccine because you did the right thing. If you're a parent and you didn't vaccinate your kids, you should be applauded because you did the research and you found out that vaccines are causing chronic disease in America. There's a study that was done by the control group. They have over a thousand people who are unvaccinated. The health outcomes in those people is night and day comparison with fully vaccinated people. We have a like a 60 percent rate of people with a chronic disease in America. If you've not been vaccinated at all, the rate is close to zero. And of course, none of this is talked about. They tried to get the CDC to do a study of the vaccinated, fully vaccinated versus the fully unvaccinated. In 2005, CDC director Judy Gerberding promised to do such a study. She said, yes, we should do such a study. It's important that we do a study now. We can refine it later. And that was nearly 20 years ago. And that study has never been done and it will never be done because they don't want people to know that all these vaccines have been harming people since the very beginning. There is no safe vaccine, not a single one. Not one vaccine is safe and effective. And I actually went on Twitter and I offered twenty five hundred dollars to anybody who could show me such a study. And nobody was able to produce such a study.
