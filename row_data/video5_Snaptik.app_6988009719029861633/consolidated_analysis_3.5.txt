Analysis 1:
Misinformation

1. The statement incorrectly suggests that 60% of people being admitted to the hospital with Covid have been double-vaccinated. This information lacks context and may mislead readers.
2. The statement oversimplifies vaccine effectiveness by stating that they are not 100% effective. It fails to highlight the significant protection vaccines provide against severe illness, hospitalization, and death.
3. The statement implies that being double-vaccinated increases the risk of hospitalization, which is misleading. Vaccination significantly reduces the risk of severe outcomes and hospitalization overall.

3. It fails to mention the overall benefit of vaccination in reducing severe illness and death despite breakthrough cases.

-----

Analysis 7:
Misinformation

1. The statement implies that 60% of all hospitalized individuals are double vaccinated, which may not be accurate as it lacks specific data on the total number of vaccinated individuals.
2. It suggests that only 10% of the vaccinated population remains at risk, overlooking variations in vaccine efficacy against different variants.
