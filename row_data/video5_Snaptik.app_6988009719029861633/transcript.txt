In terms of the number of people in hospital who've been double vaccinated, we know it's around 60% of the people being admitted to hospital with Covid have been double vaccinated. And that's not surprising because the vaccines are not 100% effective. They're very, very effective, but not 100%. And as a higher proportion of the population is double vaccinated, it's inevitable that those 10% of that very large number remain at risk and therefore will be amongst the people who both catch the infection and end up in hospital.
