You told people, they should have the vaccine. Because at the time, the scientists, and by the way, scientists is ever evolving. At the time I said that, the scientists said, if you had the vaccine, it would prevent you transmitting the virus. That turned out to be wrong, and they issued updated advice saying, further studies said that actually you could transmit it. And at that point, you know what I did, which you never do? I held my hands up, I went, I was wrong, because the advice changed, and now I would not say the same thing. That is called actually evolving opinions when facts change. That's actually how a civilized democracy works. We live in a civilized democracy, do we, sir? I actually would argue that point with you for a very long time, and I think we live in a civilized democracy.
