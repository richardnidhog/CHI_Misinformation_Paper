that I would use to help eliminate HIV. Cordyceps, it is a kidney tonic and a must-have in a kidney formula. Polk root encourages movement in the lymphatic system. White oak bark helps to clean and strengthen the GIT. Elethro root helps to enhance the activity of the endocrine system. Last but not least, black walnut hole, strong antiparasitic, strong antifungal. Thank you.
